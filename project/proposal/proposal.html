    <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
    <h2>Zachary Moring</h2>

    <p>Using PHP and Laravel, I will construct an application for my
      nonprofit's accounting. In particular, it will allow for the
      following:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Allow the user to define (and persist with a database) account
      information for double-entry ledger accounting: Name, account number,
      etc.</li>
      <li>Enter individual expenses against an account and counter-account;</li>
      <li>For detail view for an account, produce a list of all transactions
      for that account, including the running sum, etc.</li>
    </ol>
  </body>
</html>
